A collection of projects and exercises from the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate. This repository showcases my progress and skills in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and other essential tools and frameworks. Each project serves as a hands-on example of the concepts learned throughout the course, and it will continue to evolve as I build upon new knowledge.
